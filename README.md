# SecureWays
## Smart Traffic Surveillance and Detection of Suspicious Activities using YOLO

Detailed Insight : https://paradox404team.wordpress.com/

## Background

- Urbanization Trends: Growing vehicular traffic and increasing road complexity require advanced solutions.

- Existing Limitations: Manual traffic monitoring is inefficient and prone to errors. Lack of real-time, actionable insights.

- Technological Opportunity: AI-powered CCTV cameras combined with IoT can bridge these gaps.

Challenges:

1. Managing heavy urban traffic efficiently.

2. Enhancing public safety, particularly for women, using proactive surveillance and rapid response mechanisms.

Proposed Solution:
1. AI-powered traffic management system using real-time data from CCTVs and IoT sensors.
2. Incorporates AI algorithms for:
 - Traffic flow optimization.
 - Seamless integration with emergency services like Women Helpline (1090).
 - Suspicious activity detection.

## System Architecture and Major Features
1. Data Acquisition:
 - Sources: Existing CCTV networks, traffic sensors, GPS devices, and user inputs.
 - Processing Units: Centralized cloud servers or edge devices for high-speed data processing.
 - Communication: Secured networks using encrypted protocols (e.g., MQTT for IoT).

2. Real-Time AI Analysis:
 - Computer vision using YOLOv8 for object detection (vehicles, pedestrians, and anomalies).
 - Advanced algorithms for tracking, classification, and incident identification.

3. Emergency Response Integration:
 - API-driven communication with local emergency services and law enforcement.
 - Real-time alerts and automated notifications.

## Accident Detection and Segmentation

### Core Features:

-Accident Detection: Real-time identification using YOLOv8 and motion analysis.
 
-Severity Segmentation:
1. Low-Intensity: Minor fender-benders, requiring minimal intervention.
2. High-Intensity: Severe collisions requiring medical and law enforcement intervention.
3. Catastrophic: Multi-vehicle crashes or hazardous material spills needing large-scale response.

-Technical Workflow:
1. Input: Video feeds from CCTV cameras.
2. Processing: Image classification and anomaly detection using pre-trained models.
3. Output: Notifications to emergency response teams with severity ratings.

## Women’s Safety Features

1. Suspicious Activity Detection:
- Facial recognition to identify repeat offenders.
- AI monitors behavioural patterns (e.g., stalking or loitering).

2. Heatmap Generation:
- Unsafe zones visualized using aggregated incident data.
- Dynamic updates based on real-time inputs.

3. App-Based Reporting:
- Citizen-driven alerts integrated into the central monitoring system.
- Geo-tagged and timestamped incident reports for actionable insights.

## Technical Implementation

YOLO Integration:
 - Object detection and anomaly tracking using pre-trained YOLOv8 models.
 - Optimized for diverse lighting and weather conditions.
 - Vehicle detection with scale-invariant algorithms for heavy traffic scenarios.

Smartphone Integration:
 - Sensor-based data acquisition for speed monitoring and crash detection.
 - Uses accelerometer and gyroscope for detecting phone drops or rapid deceleration.

Network Infrastructure:
 - Edge Computing: Real-time processing at CCTV sites to minimize latency.
 - Cloud Storage: Secure archival of historical data for predictive analytics.
